/*The current in an alternating current circuit that contains resistance, capacitance, and inductance in series is given by:

 
Where I=current (amperes), E=voltage (volts), 
R= resistance (ohms), L= inductance (henrys), 
C= capacitance (farads) and 
f=frequency (hertz). 

Write a Java program that reads values for the voltage, resistance, inductance, capacitance and frequency, and then calculates and displays current.
